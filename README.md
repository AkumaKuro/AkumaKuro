Hey there, I’m @AkumaKuro, a pleasure to meet'cha.
I’m interested in mathematics, physics, programming yada yada...
Currently learning Java and C#.
I’m looking to collaborate on fun and interesting projects to learn from.

I currently write in Python and Java. (as well as a few other languages that I don't know well enough to mention them...)
